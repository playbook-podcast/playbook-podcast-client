# Playbook Podcast

**Playbook Podcast** - is a feature that converts subjects to podcasts.

### Problem

Problem
Modern employees are challenged by the demands of a fast-paced work environment, where staying abreast of industry subjects and content is crucial, yet finding time for traditional reading is often unfeasible. They need to maximize every minute, whether in transit, performing tasks that don't require their full attention, or during quick breaks. Furthermore, inclusivity is key in the workplace, as team members with visual impairments or who struggle with reading should have equal access to professional development materials and company updates.

### Solution

PlayBookPodcast addresses these challenges by providing an innovative feature where users can convert subjects into audio files seamlessly. This app enhances accessibility through audio playback functionality. By integrating text-to-speech technology, users can listen to their favorite subjects in a hands-free mode, making information consumption possible while engaging in other activities. The voicing mode is especially user-friendly, offering features like audio rewinding by clicking on a word and visual enhancements to support easy navigation through the content.
